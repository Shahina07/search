# Google Search Front-End Clone

This project is a front-end clone of Google Search, developed as part of the CS50 Web Programming with Python and JavaScript course. It replicates the core functionality and design of Google Search, including regular search, image search, and advanced search.

## Project Overview

This project aims to recreate the user interface and behavior of Google Search using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes three main pages:

*   `index.html`: The main Google Search page, featuring a centered search bar, search button, and "I'm Feeling Lucky" button.
*   `images.html`: A page for Google Image Search, with a similar layout to the main search page.
*   `advanced.html`: A page for Google Advanced Search, providing options for more specific searches.

## Features

*   **Regular Search:** Users can enter a query in the search bar and click "Google Search" to be redirected to Google's search results page.
*   **Image Search:** Users can search for images using the image search page.
*   **Advanced Search:** Users can refine their searches using advanced search options, including specifying all words, exact phrases, any words, and excluding words.
*   **Navigation:** Links are provided on each page to easily switch between the different search types.
*   **"I'm Feeling Lucky":**  Clicking this button redirects users directly to the first search result for their query.
*   **Responsive Design:** The layout is designed to be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes. (This can be an added feature - mention if you've implemented it).
*   **Google-like Aesthetics:** The styling aims to replicate the look and feel of Google Search.

## Technologies Used

*   HTML
*   CSS
*   JavaScript

## Setup and Installation

1.  Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/google-search-clone.git` (Replace `your-username` with your GitHub username)
2.  Open the project folder in VS Code (or your preferred code editor).
3.  Install the Live Server extension in VS Code (recommended).
4.  Open `index.html` (or any of the HTML files) and right-click to select "Open with Live Server".
5.  Your project should now be running in your web browser.

Alternatively, you can open the HTML files directly in your browser by double-clicking them in your file explorer, but you'll have to refresh the page manually to see changes.

## Usage

*   **Regular Search:** Type your query into the search bar on `index.html` and click "Google Search" or press Enter.
*   **Image Search:** Navigate to `images.html`, enter your query, and click the search button.
*   **Advanced Search:** Navigate to `advanced.html` and fill in the desired search criteria before clicking "Advanced Search".
*   **Navigation:** Use the links in the upper-right corner of each page to navigate between search types.
